#  MoneyTransfer Smart Contract

The MoneyTransfer smart contract enables users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer Ether within the Ethereum network. Users' balances are tracked through a mapping, ensuring each address maintains an accurate record of its holdings. The contract includes essential functions to handle these operations: deposit(), withdraw(uint256 amount), and transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount). Each function incorporates error handling mechanisms to ensure secure and valid transactions.

# Error Handling Mechanisms
The require statement is heavily utilized throughout the contract to validate inputs and conditions before executing state changes. For instance, in the deposit() function, require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero") ensures that the deposit amount is positive, preventing users from sending zero Ether. Similarly, in the withdraw(uint256 amount) function, require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient funds for withdrawal") ensures users have sufficient balance to withdraw the requested amount, while another require checks the success of the Ether transfer to the user. The transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) function employs require statements to ensure the sender has enough balance and that the recipient address is valid (not the zero address).

# Using require, assert, and revert
The require statement is essential for input validation and conditional checks, reverting the transaction and returning unused gas if the condition fails. This is particularly useful for validating user inputs and ensuring contract integrity before making state changes. While this contract does not use assert or revert explicitly, it is important to understand their roles: assert is used to check for conditions that should never fail and is typically reserved for internal errors and invariant checks, consuming all remaining gas if it fails; revert, on the other hand, can be used within complex conditions to revert the transaction with a specific error message, providing a more granular approach to error handling. Together, these statements enhance the contract's robustness and reliability by preventing invalid operations and ensuring the correct flow of execution.
